## Python small tools
Something I wrote when I was learning Python.
### List
#### curl.py 
a tiny curl tool in windows.
â€‹```shell
Usage: curl "[www.]site.com"
```

#### cn2alpha.py
a small tool to convert the most common chinese names to pinyin.
```shell
Usage: 
	cn2alpha.py -f cn_names.txt
	cn2alpha.py "A chinese Name Here"
	cn2alpha.py
```

-- wget.py --- a small tool to simulate 'wget' in Windows
```shell
usage: wget.py -u 'site' [options]
options:
               -h, --help              show this page.
               -u, --url               must follow an url.
               -i                      using username and password.
```
